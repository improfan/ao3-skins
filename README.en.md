Hi!
Here I will post some skins I made for ao3 (if I ever make more of them ha-ha)

So 

## How do you even create your own skin on ao3? <sup> Just in case you do not know </sup>

1. Go to your Dashboard

> [!NOTE]
> Skin Type is "Site Skin" by defualt 

> [!NOTE]
> Tilte must be unique. So you can use your username (and its variations like _[username]123_) to name the skin

>[!NOTE]
>Type and Title are required fileds, others are optional. 

"CSS" section is for custom css which overrides basic ao3 css. 

There is also a "Use Wizard" button which allows you to change font and its size and colors. Nothing more. Perfect for those who are not familiar with css and who don't want to make it more complicated.
